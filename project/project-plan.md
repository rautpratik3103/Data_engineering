# Project Plan

## Title
Crime Rates and Unemployment Rates in the USA (2020-2023)

## Main Question
How do unemployment rates impact crime rates across different regions in the USA from 2020 to 2023?

## Description
This project investigates the relationship between unemployment rates and crime rates in the USA during the period from 2020 to 2023. The analysis aims to determine if there is a correlation between fluctuations in unemployment and changes in crime rates across various regions. By studying this relationship, the project will provide insights that could be beneficial for policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and social scientists in understanding how economic factors influence crime.

The study will involve data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical modeling to reveal patterns and correlations between these two variables. The findings will be illustrated through visualizations to highlight the regional variations and overall trends.

## Data Sources
**Datasource 1: Crime Data**
- **Data URL**: [USA Los Angeles Crimes Data 2020 to 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishmaelkiptoo/usa-los-angeles-crimes-data-2020-to-2023)
- **Data Type**: CSV
- **Description**: Contains detailed information on crime occurrences, including types of crimes, locations, and timestamps. This dataset will help in analyzing crime trends over the selected period.

**Datasource 2: Unemployment Rates Data**
- **Data URL**: [Unemployment Rates by Demographics (1978-2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/unemployment-rates-by-demographics-1978-2023)
- **Data Type**: CSV
- **Description**: Provides data on unemployment rates, including demographics and regional details. This dataset is crucial for understanding unemployment trends and correlating them with crime rates.

## Work Packages

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Load the crime and unemployment datasets using Pandas.
- Clean and preprocess data by handling missing values, filtering the data for the years 2020 to 2023, and aligning both datasets by region and time period.
- Merge the datasets based on common attributes like region and date for comprehensive analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conduct EDA using Matplotlib and Pandas to identify trends and patterns in crime and unemployment rates.
- Plot time series and scatter plots to visualize trends over the specified period.
- Examine any initial observable correlations between unemployment rates and crime rates across different regions.

### 3. Data Modeling and Analysis
- Utilize NumPy for statistical calculations.
- Apply regression analysis and correlation techniques to assess the relationship between unemployment rates and crime rates.
- Analyze the results to interpret the strength and direction of any correlations identified.

### 4. Visualization of Results
- Create line charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps using Matplotlib to illustrate the relationship between unemployment and crime rates.
- Highlight regional differences and significant findings through clear and informative visuals.

### 5. Documentation and Report
- Document the process, analysis, and findings.
- Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing insights into how unemployment trends relate to changes in crime rates during 2020-2023.

## Expected Outcome
The analysis aims to reveal whether there is a significant relationship between unemployment rates and crime rates in the USA during the period studied. This insight will help identify patterns that can inform policy decisions and strategic interventions.
