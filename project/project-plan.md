# Project Plan

## Title
**Air Quality Index and Agricultural Crop Production in India**

## Main Question

How does the air quality index (AQI) impact agricultural crop production across different regions of India?

## Description

This project explores the relationship between air quality and agricultural crop production in India. With the increase in air pollution levels, the air quality index in many regions has been adversely affected, which may impact the growth and yield of crops. By analyzing AQI data alongside agricultural yield data, we aim to identify potential correlations between air pollution levels and crop productivity. This insight can be valuable for policymakers and farmers, as it highlights areas where poor air quality might pose risks to agriculture and, consequently, food security. Our analysis will involve data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical modeling to reveal these trends.

## Data Sources

### Datasource 1: Air Quality Data
- **Data URL**: [Kaggle - Air Quality Data in India](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/air-quality-data-in-india)
- **Data Type**: CSV
- **Description**: Contains information on air quality indices across various regions in India, including pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2. This dataset provides AQI measurements essential for analyzing pollution trends and their potential impact on agriculture.

### Datasource 2: Agricultural Production Data
- **Data URL**: [Kaggle - Agriculture Data for India](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thammuio/all-agriculture-related-datasets-for-india)
- **Data Type**: CSV
- **Description**: Provides data on crop yields, types of crops, and production volumes across different states and regions of India. This dataset is key to understanding how crop productivity varies in response to environmental factors, including air quality.

## Work Packages

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Load and clean the AQI and agriculture datasets using **Pandas** to handle missing values and merge datasets by region and time period.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Conduct EDA using **Matplotlib** and **Pandas** to identify patterns in AQI and crop yields across regions, checking for any observable correlations.

3. **Data Modeling and Analysis**
   - Use **NumPy** for statistical calculations and model building to assess the relationship between AQI values and crop yields, applying regression or correlation analysis.

4. **Visualization of Results**
   - Create charts and heatmaps with **Matplotlib** to showcase the impact of air pollution on crop production across different regions in India.

5. **Documentation and Report**
   - Document findings and prepare a final report summarizing insights on how air quality may affect agricultural productivity.
